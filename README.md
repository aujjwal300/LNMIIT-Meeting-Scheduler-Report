%# LNMIIT Meeting Scheduler

%### Problem Statement:<br/>
%The conventional process of scheduling meetings at our college involves tedious back-and-forths, making it time-consuming and prone to errors. To streamline this, we propose a solution that integrates with Google Calendar and allows users to efficiently identify and book common free slots based on the availability of participants in Google Calendar. 

%### Tech Stack Used:<br/>
%•	Frontend Framework: ReactJS with Vite <br/>
%•	Styling: Tailwind CSS<br/>
%•	Integration: Google Calendar API<br/>

%### Steps:
[//]: # ( 1.	Login with LNMIIT ID: Users must log in using their LNMIIT ID for authentication.)
%2.	Participant List: Users can input a list of email IDs of people they wish to invite to the meeting. Bulk input is supported for convenience.
%3.	Date Selection: Choose the desired meeting date from the provided calendar.
%4.	Fetch Availability: Click the "Fetch" button to retrieve and visualize free slots of participants from 8 am to 6 pm (Default and can change accordingly).
%5.	Visualization: The right-hand side displays a simple visualization of free slots for each participant.
%6.	Common Availability: The bottom of the page shows the common free slots available for scheduling.
%7.	Schedule Google event: Users can click on a preferred free slot, and the app will populate the Google Calendar with the necessary details for easy meeting scheduling.

%### Future Work:
%1.	Guidelines for Faculty and Staff: Develop guidelines and encourage faculty and staff members to use Google Calendar for their classes and labs.
%2.	Permission and Multiple Calendar Management: Implement a robust permission system to ensure that the app has the necessary access to check free slots and can manage participants' multiple Google Calendars.

%### Challenges:
%1.	Faculty Adoption: Encouraging faculty and staff to consistently use Google Calendar for scheduling.
%2.	Permission Handling: Managing permissions for accessing and retrieving calendar data from participants.
%3.	Integration Complexity: Dealing with the intricacies of integrating with the Google Calendar API.
